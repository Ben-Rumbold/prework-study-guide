# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage features notes on the four main topics that a web development student needs to learn. These topics are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. I was motivated to create the Prework Study Guide to make the students life as easy as possible in organising their notes on the above topics. This will in turn allow the student to search for answers to potential problems with ease and hopefully find the correct answer in a swift manner. During the creation of this project I learnt that JavaScript is the most complex of the three languages needed for front end web development.

## Usage

The intended use for the prework study guide is as a note taking app for students of the front end web development bootcamp. The webpage will list the notes the learner has inputted from prework, and then randonmly choose one topic for the student to study first.
